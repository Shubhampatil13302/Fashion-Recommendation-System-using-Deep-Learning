# Fashion-Recommendation-System-using-Deep-Learning
A deep learning–based fashion recommendation system that suggests visually similar clothing items using image features. The model leverages a pre-trained VGG16 convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract meaningful visual patterns and compares them using cosine similarity to find matches.
This project demonstrates how computer vision and transfer learning can enhance user experience in e-commerce by providing image-based recommendations — no text or tags required.
